Contributions are welcome but acceptance is completely up to tastybento. Do not be offended if your contribution is rejected.
I will not accept any contributions that are formatting only, or mostly formatting.
Automated code cleanup is also not a valid contribution as a first Pull Request. If a tool is doing your job,
the submit an issue that recommends we use a specific tool.
Contributions are accepted under the license terms and conditions. Note that this means we may use them elsewhere.
Thank you!
